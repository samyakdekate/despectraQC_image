# ‚öõÔ∏è DESPECTRA: Quantum-Driven Spectral Analysis and Enhancement of Digital Images

**Project for [IIITN Hackathon Name - Replace Me]**

### üí° The Idea: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Image Processing

DESPECTRA is a **quantum-classical hybrid framework** designed to perform advanced image analysis and enhancement, specifically targeting subtle spectral features and improving visual clarity beyond traditional methods. We leverage the unique computational power of quantum mechanics (simulated via **Qiskit**) for tasks like edge detection and contrast enhancement.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Results

1.  **Quantum Edge Detection:** Uses a 2-qubit circuit with **RY rotations** (for pixel encoding) and **CNOT/Hadamard gates** (for entanglement and superposition) to detect pixel intensity differences. [cite_start]This method yields sharper edges and less noise compared to the classical **Sobel operator**. [cite: 280-281, 393-395, 399-401]
2.  [cite_start]**Quantum Contrast Enhancement:** Applies a single-qubit circuit with an **RY rotation** followed by an **X-gate** (inversion) to redistribute brightness levels, significantly enhancing image clarity and visibility of subtle features. [cite: 278-279, 403-405]
3.  **Hybrid Architecture:** The system uses **Python/OpenCV** for classical preprocessing (resizing, grayscale) and **Qiskit Aer Simulator** for quantum circuit execution. [cite_start]This structure is designed for current simulation environments and future deployment on real **quantum hardware**. [cite: 42, 46, 159-160, 232]
4.  [cite_start]**Data-Driven Validation:** We provide statistical and visual outputs, including a **Pixel Difference Heatmap** and a **Statistical Comparison Report**, demonstrating a clear quantitative advantage in metrics like PSNR and SSIM. [cite: 44, 407-409, 422-425]
