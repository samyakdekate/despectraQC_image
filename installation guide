Here is a concise installation guide for your DESPECTRA: Quantum-Driven Spectral Analysis and Enhancement of Digital Images project.

⚛️ DESPECTRA Installation Guide
This guide details how to set up the Python environment and run the main demonstration notebook for the DESPECTRA project.

1. Prerequisites
You'll need a stable environment with the following software installed:


Python: Version 3.8 or later.

Git: For cloning the repository.

Jupyter Notebook: To run the main demonstration file.

Hardware (Recommended):

Processor: Intel Core i7 (10th Gen) / AMD Ryzen 7 or higher.

RAM: 16 GB or higher (for faster quantum simulation).

Operating System: Windows 10/11 or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later).

2. Environment Setup
It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., conda or venv) to manage dependencies.

A. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands:

Bash

# 1. Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/Despectra-Quantum-Image-Analysis.git

# 2. Navigate into the project directory
cd Despectra-Quantum-Image-Analysis
B. Install Dependencies

The project relies on specific versions of key quantum and classical libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Bash

# Install all required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# --- Required Libraries ---
# Qiskit & Qiskit-Aer: For quantum circuit creation and simulation [cite: 160]
# OpenCV: For classical image preprocessing [cite: 161]
# NumPy & SciPy: For matrix operations and numerical computation [cite: 162]
# Matplotlib: For histogram plotting and visualization [cite: 163]
3. Running the Demonstration
The core project demonstration, including Quantum Edge Detection and Contrast Enhancement comparisons, is run via the Jupyter Notebook.

A. Launch Jupyter

Execute the following command in the project's root directory:

Bash

jupyter notebook
B. Open and Run the Notebook

In the browser window, navigate to the notebooks folder.

Open mini_qc-checkpoint.ipynb.

Execute all cells in the notebook sequentially (use the "Run All" command in the notebook interface).

The notebook will perform the following steps and display the results:

Load and resize the input image from the /data/ folder .

Perform Quantum Edge Detection and display the output alongside the Classical Sobel baseline .

Perform Quantum Contrast Enhancement and generate the Pixel Difference Heatmap .

Display the Statistical Comparison Report (Avg Brightness, PSNR, SSIM, etc.) .

4. Code & Documentation Access

Source Code: The core quantum-classical logic can be found in the /src/ folder (if refactored) .


Full Report: The detailed project report is available in the /report/ directory as a PDF
